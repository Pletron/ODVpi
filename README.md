# ODVpi
Master thesis project: Evaluate real time system performance using [OpenDaVinci](https://github.com/se-research/OpenDaVINCI/).

### Code
The evaluation is done through two different types of code:

* [TimeTriggerCode](https://github.com/Pletron/ODVpi/tree/master/TimeTriggerCode)
  * Code ran as slave to the [OpenDaVinci](https://github.com/se-research/OpenDaVINCI/) component `supercomponent`.
* [RealTimeCode](https://github.com/Pletron/ODVpi/tree/master/RealTimeCode)
  * Code ran standalone without any dependencies to a particular parent.
